      "title": "Deciphering the ESG Enigma: The Power and Promise of Corporate Sustainability",
      "description": "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics have existed for over a century. These criteria originated mainly from socially conscious investors who wanted to align their investments with their values, though initially lacking a clear execution plan and an efficient way to measure results. Initiatives like the 'Quaker Friends Fiduciary No-sin investments' (1890) are known today as the seeds of ESG.\n\nWhile these proposals had excellent intentions, the lack of an execution plan and an efficient way to measure results kept the world for almost a century without any advancement in improving environmental metrics and especially without a way to globally standardize the measurement of how we interact with the planet.\n\nUnfortunately, it took multiple disasters such as the Chernobyl disaster (1980), the detection of the ozone layer hole in (1985), or the Exxon Valdez disaster in (1989) for governments, entrepreneurs, activists, among others, to truly awaken to the need to develop a methodology and guidelines to encourage and corroborate that business practices could be more responsible towards the planet.\n\nIt seemed that finally, the environmental issue was starting to be addressed. However, other issues quickly arose, and experts identified that the solution had to be more comprehensive and consider many other aspects that were not being addressed at the moment but were highly correlated.\n\nDuring the 1990s, with the advent of the digital era, it became possible to firsthand learn about social problems no matter where they occurred. Concepts like Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) began to consider their impact on society and the environment, as well as their corporate governance practices. It was also during this period that various standards and guidelines for sustainability reporting were developed, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, several notable financial events occurred that had a significant impact on the global economy. The dot-com bubble (2001), the accounting frauds of Enron (2001) and Worldcom (2002), and the subprime mortgage crisis (2007) led to job losses, stock price declines, and widespread loss of confidence in the financial system and responsible business practices.\n\nThe lessons learned from these events helped shape the current financial regulatory environment and led to the development of new non-financial instruments and regulations aimed at preventing similar crises in the future, but above all giving a responsible purpose to the use of capital among the investment community.\n\nThe final blow to bring what we now know as ESG factors into play has been the emergence of more and better data, as well as a better understanding of the environmental and social pressures of modernity, which can now be regulated and legitimized thanks to the development of financial instruments that are accessible to the investment community.\n\nMany investors and asset managers now consider ESG factors when making investment decisions, and many companies are incorporating ESG considerations into their business strategies and reporting practices.\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) data tends to capture non-financial factors that were traditionally absent in financial analysis: business management of energy and water use, waste generation, employee rights and working conditions, community involvement, data privacy rights, and more. Traditional indicators of corporate responsibility and transparency.\n\nToday, ESG is considered key in assessing the financial performance and long-term sustainability of a company trading publicly and internationally. It has become an integral part of the investment process, and more and more companies recognize the need to address ESG issues to meet the expectations of their stakeholders and improve their overall performance.\n\nIn short, as Rochelle March, Head of ESG Product at Dun & Bradstreet, comments, “ESG encapsulates almost everything that can reflect how companies operate within society and the environment, and whether that mode of operation is sustainable and responsible”."

      "title": "Unraveling the Green Engine: The Magic behind Cacta's Operation",
      "description": "We all know the impact of climate change on the planet. But... Did you know that the agricultural system accounts for nearly one-third (31%) of global carbon emissions? And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Our planet already exceeds defined limits for other categories such as biodiversity loss or resource depletion.\n\n At Cacta, we understand the magnitude of the problem and the need to take action to reduce our impact and improve our relationship with the environment. That's why we've designed a pioneering environmental management tool exclusively for the agricultural sector. It is the first of its kind, capable of merging productive information with environmental impact indicators backed by science. The tool consists of three modules:\n\n The first one (A) focuses on semi-automatically extracting data from agricultural clients by integrating it into their management systems.\n\n In the second module (B), we focus on classifying and transforming the information into an inventory of environmental emissions for each client. We use the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) methodology according to ISO 14040/44 regulations, following European standards to calculate the inventory phase. During this stage, we consider everything from the production of various inputs and energies to their application in the field, taking into account local factors such as soil pH.\n\n The third module (C) focuses on translating this information into environmental impact indicators, following the recommendations of the European Commission. We present these indicators visually in interactive dashboards and product information cards. Additionally, the tool includes a benchmark and an Eco Score. \n\n Scope: The current version of Cacta Agro focuses on determining the environmental impacts associated with the production of agricultural crops from 'cradle' to 'gate.'\n\n This involves computing the inventory from the generation of raw materials and energies to the harvesting of the product. By extracting information directly from various activities, we associate the use of inputs or machinery with each particular batch and crop. For cases where it is not possible, the mass allocation method is applied. For the particular case of machinery hours, we use area weighting."

      "description": "On September 25, 2015, world leaders adopted a set of global goals to eradicate poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years (2030). Therefore, the Sustainable Development Goals have been agreed upon by all governments. However, their success will depend on the actions taken by everyone, both companies and governments.\n\n The SDGs offer the opportunity to develop and implement solutions and technologies from the business sector, allowing the largest challenges established in terms of sustainable development to be addressed.\n\n At the same time, these are part of a global agenda for the development of our societies. They establish that market-leading companies must demonstrate that the businesses they conduct help lead us towards sustainable development. Despite seeming complex to align with these objectives, the truth is that it is not. It's a matter of conducting a thorough materiality assessment, identifying productive processes within companies, and obtaining clear and reliable traceability.\n\n The United Nations assures that there are key benefits to generating alignment with sustainable development goals, including: \n\nImproving operational efficiency throughout the supply chain, strengthening relationships with customers, consumers, and suppliers, as well as reducing environmental and health and safety risks."

      "title": "He Created Environmental Impact Measurement Software and Asserts: 'Sustainability Is Here to Stay'",
      "description": "This is about a citrus producer from Tucumán who, together with a group of friends, founded an environmental certification company. 'This isn't about selling at a higher price; it's about not being left out,' he asserts.\n\n'Cacta comes from cactus, which is the plant that grows in the desert despite extreme climatic adversities. It gives life to the desert, to the animals, and it stores water. It also blooms. And blooming for us means understanding that Argentina can rise again with innovation and technology.'\n\nJosé Luis Cebe, 32, visited the recent Aapresid Congress in Buenos Aires. His company 'Cacta' was founded just two years ago and was the way he envisioned addressing some of the commercial 'pains' that Argentine agricultural producers experience today.\n\n'This didn't arise out of necessity, but rather out of the obligation as an agro-exporting company to show reports and demonstrate to the world what we do. Sustainability is here to stay,' he defined in a conversation with Infocampo.\n\nWhat did they do? Along with a group of friends spread across Europe, including Barcelona, Spain, and Frankfurt, Germany, they decided to create environmental impact measurement software.\n\n'We follow the life cycle assessment methodology automatically, where we collect data from producers automatically so they don't have the administrative burden of manually entering the data. That is a burden for them,' he explained.\n\nCacta currently measures not just one, but more than a dozen measurable indicators. These include variables such as:\n\n- Total carbon footprint\n- Potential acidification\n- Water eutrophication\n- Water ecotoxicity\n- Carcinogens\n- Non-carcinogens\n- Ozone depletion\n- Smog\n- Non-renewables\n- Minerals and metals\n\n'We have an optimized algorithm that records more than 70,000 emissions into soil, air, and water, and 27,000 environmental records,' they state on their website.\n\nThe youth of his company led him to visit the event, but he has not yet set up his own stand. The goal is part of Cebe's dreams, but he knows that today it is more important to solidify certain processes, typical of entrepreneurship and the ups and downs of agriculture. And of Argentina.\n\n'The educational work is being done well because at any agricultural congress we attend, the main thematic axes are related to sustainability. But I do think that the ways of incorporating environmental and sustainability management into producers are proving difficult,' he analyzed.\n\nAnd he emphasized: 'The message is well delivered. We need to refine the how because we need to measure to know where we stand.'\n\n'The producer who is reluctant to incorporate environmental or sustainability management into their company will be left out of the market. It will be extremely difficult for them to sell their products, and they will have no choice but to incorporate, measure, and demonstrate their environmental impact,' he asserted.\n\nAnd he added along the same lines: 'Incorporating environmental management is not about selling at a higher price; it's about not being left out of the markets. Let's not pretend to sell our product at a higher price if we show an environmental impact certificate; this is simply to ensure that in the medium or short term, we are not left out.'\n\nBeyond intentions, putting into practice the possibility of keeping the productive wheel turning can become a thorny path. Cebe knows this, but he seeks to keep Cacta moving and remain faithful to the entrepreneurial drive.\n\nSometimes, the relationship with larger-scale companies with experience in the sector is encouraging due to their feedback. But in many cases, the established routine leaves no time for formal presentations and explanations.\n\n'It happens to me that when I want to explain this to some of the 'giants' in the chain, it is difficult to get them to listen. But, well, we have to keep trying to show what we do, present it, and work to make it known, and for good ideas to become real,' he stated.\n\nBut he acknowledged: 'Trust and the legal framework, and intellectual property are well established. We don't have problems with that. What we do have a problem with is communicating what we do because we are not always listened to by large companies. They have their day-to-day, which is an overwhelming rush, and sitting down to listen to four entrepreneurs who developed a system can be difficult for them.'\n\n'But we must never stop knocking on doors because I'm sure that the only way for Argentina, as an agro-exporting country, to incorporate environmental management is if all actors in the chain are integrated,' he defined.\n\nHowever, the daily grind takes its toll.\n\n'Every day, I have fears and worries about the success of Cacta. But I also have a lot of faith because it is a very new and innovative product. The guys behind this are geniuses. I think we feel the same as anyone who forms a startup,' he concluded.",

      "title": "A Positive Point in the Environmental Footprint of Argentine Agriculture: 'The Level of Digitalization is Very Good'",
      "description": "One of the founders of Cacta, a young company dedicated to certification management and traceability, highlighted the work being done by producers in the core agricultural area.\n\nEach generation undertakes according to the models of its time. What used to mean long hours away from home, sometimes for days or weeks, globalization now allows combining different production models.\n\nThe Argentine agro-industry contains many stories of that nature. From agricultural producers who cultivated the land and passed on the smell of the soil and contact with production animals, to young entrepreneurs with the same drive and vision, but who bet on sophisticating that primary generation in the field.\n\nCacta is an Argentine company that followed those guidelines. It was founded by José Luis Cebe and Luciano Sambataro, who are now located thousands of kilometers apart from each other, one in Tucumán and the other in Frankfurt, Germany, but with enough connection and understanding to run a company that bets heavily on environmental measurement management and the corresponding measurement of indicators.\n\nSambataro spoke with Infocampo a few days ago at the premises of the Argentine Rural Society in Palermo. There, just meters away from the Hereford Centennial Expo, he explained in detail the current state of the company and the vision of the team moving forward.\n\n'Cacta is a company that develops environmental measurement software. The idea came about approximately two and a half years ago, when I went to Germany to pursue a PhD and began to deeply understand what environmental measurement is all about,' Sambataro commented.\n\nHOW TO BETTER MEASURE THE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT\n\n-What methodologies exist and what is Argentina's potential?\n\n-Agriculture is a sector with a track record of innovation. In fact, as we developed this company, we created the measurement software and realized that it has a lot to show in terms of sustainability potential. That's how the idea was born, we are five partners. We have an IT team in Argentina, and we are dedicated to the holistic measurement of environmental impacts.\n\n-What attracts you to the world of agricultural producers, given that your academic career had not fully immersed you in that field?\n\n-In reality, I am a civil engineer. But sustainability, as a concept, encompasses all industries, and particularly what we do, which is to apply life cycle analysis methodology. That has potential that can be applied to any industry. In Europe, we see that the construction industry is very advanced in this area.\n\n-Why?\n\n-Well, cement has always been in the spotlight. It’s an industry that represents 6% of global carbon dioxide emissions. And we saw that Argentina had enormous potential to showcase. We had lemon production in Tucumán, which led to the vision we developed and resulted in the software we have in the market today.\n\n-What do you think are the responsibilities an entrepreneur has towards their company?\n\n-First, to be clear about the vision, know where to go, and set the foundational pillars. In our case, the vision was clear: to develop a tool that would truly generate positive change, and for that, you need to first measure and know what the reference scenario is to then start applying practices that lead to a sustainable business model over time. Also, work ethics are one of the pillars we have as a business model.\n\n-How diverse is Argentine agriculture when analyzed region by region?\n\n-In terms of measurement, it's transversal to all regions, but what we see is that the level of information or how digitized the agricultural industry is, whether it be in the core region with extensive or specialty crops, like in the North, is very high. The data is available.\n\n-What does that allow?\n\n-Automating the measurement. It’s about transforming that data into new indicators. We see that the level of data generation and digitalization is very good.\n\n-What do you think Argentine agriculture will be like in 10 years?\n\n-I believe that the economies that are changing first or are already required to demonstrate or measure sustainability impact are those that first reach the consumer. Today we see a growing demand in Europe for traceability and the measurement of more and more indicators. What started with the carbon footprint and the water footprint is a very important issue. That agenda, which in Europe was driven by the Climate Law and the 'Green Deal,' has already arrived in Argentina, and very quickly.\n\n-How are companies adapting?\n\n-We are seeing a change from the beginning of the year to the end, in the sense that companies now need to start measuring. That's why I believe that in 10 years, this will not only be a reality, but it will also be a reason why one cannot enter certain markets.\n\n-You live in Europe. What do you encounter each time you go out into the field there?\n\n–Over there, regulations are obviously stricter when it comes to sustainability. However, here we have the potential that practices tend to be very environmentally friendly. In no-till farming, we are pioneers, and we have the potential to demonstrate and compete, not only in terms of productivity but also in showing that our way of managing the land is more sustainable. We are realizing that we are doing it well, and that is one more reason to be proud.",

      "title": "An Argentine Startup Bets on AI and WhatsApp to Streamline Agriculture",
      "description": "The Argentine startup Bipolos has introduced PIA, an artificial intelligence solution designed to transform how agricultural producers quote and purchase supplies.\n\nThis new digital tool, which can be accessed via WhatsApp, enables instant quotes from multiple agricultural suppliers across the country. It aims to simplify decision-making while optimizing costs.\n\nBipolos, which in just one year became the fastest-growing agricultural supply marketplace in Argentina, has taken a further step with the launch of PIA. According to its founder, Juan Manuel Birolo, this AI is fed in real time by Bipolos’ platform, providing accurate quotes tailored to the producers' needs.\n\n\"We launched PIA just a week ago during Expoagro. This project took months of development and evolved alongside our platform, which serves as the real-time data source PIA uses to deliver accurate quotes,\" Birolo told El Cronista.\n\nThe system has been very well received in the sector. \"The response has been incredible. Producers who weren’t very comfortable using the platform now find a much more natural alternative in PIA. Its response speed and continuous learning capabilities, which set it apart from a conventional bot, are aspects that users highlight,\" added Bipolos’ founder.\n\nJuan Manuel Birolo, founder of Bipolos.\n\nPIA integrates with WhatsApp, making it easy to adopt.

      "title": "The Cacta Case: Luciano Sambataro Explains How This App Works to Measure Environmental Impact (Not Just the Carbon Footprint) to Reach New Markets",
      "description": "The 'boom' of Agtechs, the new tech companies linked to agriculture, is largely driven by the generational shift occurring in the sector. Luciano Sambataro is a young civil engineer who, while drinking beer in Germany with a friend who is a lemon producer, realized there was an untapped opportunity: Measuring environmental impact in agricultural production.\n\nJosé Luis Cebe, from a citrus family, was excited about the project, and thus Cacta was born—the app that today allows producers to measure how sustainable their practices are, correct imbalances, and seize the opportunities offered by new markets. Most importantly, it doesn't just focus on the well-known carbon footprint. What’s interesting about this Agtech is that it considers environmental care as a way to optimize the production process and achieve economic benefits. 'Being sustainable isn’t just about philanthropy; it’s also about doing business that lasts,' Luciano explained to Bichos de Campo.\n\nThe ISO Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, the set of standards that underpins Cacta, is already used by large companies worldwide to evaluate where the greatest ecological impact occurs in the production chain. If a producer can report their impact through indicators, they will likely have more access to these markets.\n\nSince this is a relatively new phenomenon in agriculture, environmental care is often associated with the carbon footprint and green bonds. A serious mistake, according to the civil engineer, who explained that measuring the footprint 'not only is insufficient' but 'can even be harmful' if management decisions are made solely based on that popular variable.\n\nRather than just measuring greenhouse gas emissions, Sambataro emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach. 'So, what other variables should be measured?' we asked, and he referred to two key areas: Water footprint and substance toxicity.\n\nThe good news is that producers have been recording many key aspects of their production, such as inputs used, technology employed, or energy consumption, making the algorithmic processing by the system easier to generate indicators. Additionally, the co-founder noted that they offer manual data entry for producers who are not tech-savvy.\n\nThe result is the reports producers receive periodically, which help identify where adjustments are needed and which processes can justify higher prices. 'All of this is designed for action. Both to correct what’s wrong and to add more value to what’s done right,' he explained. To ensure the measurements are as accurate as possible, the system takes into account the producer’s location, soil studies, and additional weather information.\n\nFor a company that was founded just 3 years ago, the growth potential is tied not only to the proposal itself but, fundamentally, to the users they can attract. And since the app is not free but requires an annual subscription, they must convince producers that measuring their environmental impact will be profitable.\n\nThe truth is that Sambataro had traveled to Frankfurt to pursue a Ph.D. in life cycle analysis, a measurement methodology gaining momentum in the First World. His idea was to apply it with a system agile and simple enough for any producer to get a comprehensive environmental impact analysis without needing to consult other experts.\n\n'With the benefits they can access just by starting to measure, it pays for itself,' Sambataro assured. Furthermore, they have built strategic partnerships to boost usage, with both private banks offering discounts on rates to Cacta users and other growing Agtechs.\n\nThe most recent partnership, announced during Expoagro, was with Bipolos, an agricultural commerce platform where they integrated the ability to assess the environmental impact of what is about to be purchased.",
